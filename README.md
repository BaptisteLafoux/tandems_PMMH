# Tandems @PMMH laboratory
[Tandem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandem_language_learning) is a great way to learn a language : you meet once a week just to chat. 
 
This code generates random tandems groups from a Google Sheet (answers to a Google Form) and generates email 
 
If you want to use this code : 
 - Clone the repo by doing in your terminal
```
git clone https://github.com/BaptisteLafoux/tandem_PMMH.git
```
- Install the required packages with :
```
conda install --file requirements.txt
```
or 
```
pip install requirements.txt
```

After that you should edit the file `pairs_and_emails_generator.py` and then run it. You can choose :
- The url of you Google Sheet
- The body of the email 
- The subject of the email 

Do not hesitate to get in touch with me if you have any question !
